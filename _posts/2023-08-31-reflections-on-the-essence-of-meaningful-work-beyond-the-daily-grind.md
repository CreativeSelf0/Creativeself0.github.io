# What Constitutes Meaningful Work?

Over the past year, I've grappled with the pursuit of meaning in my daily endeavors, seeking to identify what truly qualifies as productive and purposeful. Often, we find ourselves caught up in routines that merely help us pass the time, falling into habitual patterns without much thought. The typical cycle of sleeping for 6-8 hours, followed by breakfast, an 8-hour workday, a trip to the gym lasting an hour, and eventually returning home, can consume a substantial 18 hours of our day, factoring in the commute if fortunate enough to have the gym and workplace nearby. This leaves us with a mere 6 hours, which can all too easily be spent on low-energy activities that offer fleeting dopamine rushes, like socializing, video games, TV shows, and movies.

Reflecting on this, I posed a fundamental question to myself: **What truly qualifies as productive?** It's evident that reducing the concept of productive time to these remaining 6 hours highlights a profound issue with how we perceive and engage in activities deemed productive.

Delving into research, I discovered that many individuals struggle to find a sense of fulfillment in their pursuits, seeking endeavors that they consider worthwhile and purpose-driven. The challenge of employee disengagement has persisted for decades, exacerbated in recent years by phenomena such as the [Great Resignation](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/this-week-in-leadership/finding-purpose-during-the-great-resignation) and [Quiet Quitting](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/this-week-in-leadership/keep-your-workers-from-quiet-quitting).

These terms hold intriguing connotations. They underscore that meaningful work transcends the mere function of earning a living. Meaningful work resonates with our values, stimulates our curiosity, and aligns with our moral compass. It encapsulates a sense of fulfillment and value for employees, where their daily contributions are acknowledged and intertwined with something larger than their personal interests.

In essence, meaningful work stretches beyond a mere nine-to-five job; it embodies a deeper connection to what we do and why we do it. It's an aspiration that requires us to examine our activities and consider how they contribute to a greater purpose, both for ourselves and the world around us.
