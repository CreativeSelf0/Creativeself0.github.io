## Welcome to my blog!

I'm Abdulmajeed Al-Muarik, a software engineer from Saudi Arabia. I'm a full-stack developer, and I'm passionate about learning new things and sharing my knowledge with others.

I'm currently working as a Researcher at Research Center where I work on Speech Processing and Computer Vision. I mostly work on speech, but sometimes I work on computer vision. In my free time, I like to spend my time at the gym or reading books about AI, philosophy, or software engineering.
