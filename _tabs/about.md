## About Me
I am Abdulmajeed Al-Muarik, an Applied Researcher and Machine Learning Engineer working in a research center. My primary focus lies in speech, natural language, and computer vision. I am deeply driven by my passion for exploring cutting-edge advancements in technology, with a strong determination to bridge the gap between humans and machines.


## Why Programming?

When people ask about what do I do, I often speak about computer programming, and I can see their eyes glaze over. But to me, programming isn't just typing lines of code. It's a form of art and expression. Imagine being able to create entire worlds, realities, and experiences with just words. Every line of code is like a brushstroke on a canvas, and with each function or algorithm, I'm breathing life into a blank digital space.

In our physical world, we're bound by laws of nature. In the world of programming, I am the creator, the architect. But with that power comes immense responsibility and reflection. Each project is a journey where I confront and wrestle with problems, seek out solutions, and often discover more about my own thinking patterns and biases than I'd ever imagined.

When I code, I'm not just interacting with a machine; I'm engaging in a deep dialogue with myself, questioning, iterating, and growing. It's a dance of logic and creativity, structure and spontaneity. So, while on the surface, it might seem like a mundane technical task, to me, programming is a deeply fun and philosophical pursuit, a canvas where I both lose and find myself.
