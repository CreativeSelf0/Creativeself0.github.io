##  Home Machine
This is the majority of my work is done from work-related stuff to hobbies/open-source projects. I don't train large ML/DL models on my home machine / I mostly use for browsing, reading, gaming, and sshing to my work machine when I want to train / explore ideas. Therefore, I don't try to abuse my home machine. However, I do abuse my work machine where I SSH to it to do most of my work.
